Project Summary: This project is a Python program that interacts with users to collect their name and age. It ensures that:
- Name Validation: The user's name consists only of letters. If not, it shows an error message.
- Age Validation: The user's age is a number within a realistic range (between 1 and 119). If it's not a number or it's out of this range, it displays an error message.
- Greeting: If everything is correct, it greets the user with their name and age.
